## Updated Project Idea

System we are designing is still a mobile application that allows customers to make restaurant reservations by
selecting date, time, number of people, and seat preference. Customers can sign in as a guest or log in to their
accounts. Customers can view a list of restaurants that are grouped by categories. A restaurants information
such as address, distance away, rating, review, images, etc. is displayed when clicked upon. Customers can
preview restaurants menus to decide if they want to make a reservation. After making a reservation customer
can preorder food items and add other accounts/people to a reservation. Customers are also able to write
reviews for a restaurant.

## Three Ideas

##### I. Customer is able to click the preorder button and is able to add things to the food cart of

##### that reservation

- The user is able to click on a confirmed reservation and preorder
- The user is able to add and remove items from the food cart
- When the user checks-out, they are taken to the payment page

##### II. Customer is able to modify reservation

- The user is able to change the date and time of a confirmed reservation
- The user host is able to add and remove other users from this reservation
- The invited user is able to remove themselves from the reservation

##### III. Navigation bar with buttons at the bottom

- The four most important buttons are displayed at the bottom. (Restaurants, Search,

##### Reservation, Account)

- The navigation bar is not always displayed in every screen of the app
- The buttons have both an icon and text to display what button it is

## Storyboard

##### A group of students have a reservation on Halloween at 6pm for 4 people. Since it happened to

##### snow recently, some roads are closed so the students decide to change the reservation for next

##### Friday at the same time. Unfortunately, one of the students got sick the day before Friday and

##### won’t be able to come, so the students change the reservation from 4 to 3 people that will attend.


## Cognitive Evaluation

##### During our prototyping and task-centered system cognitive walkthrough we found some of our

##### tasks were not needed for our app and some we needed to add. We decided to break the tasks

##### into 5 major tasks and made the steps what we could do with that task.

##### The restaurant tasks, where the restaurant could confirm that the group for the reservation has

##### arrived and allowing them to customize their own page. We decided that implementing this during

##### our prototype stage was going to be too much, we would have to create a separate UI for the

##### restaurant.

##### The task where we have that users can see the menu after booking was limiting the user. We

##### changed the task so the viewer can just view the menu when they view the restaurant instead of

##### having to book first.

##### We also decided to change how the sharable link task works. Instead, people would have to have

##### an account, the host would be able to add users by their email linked with their account. We

##### included some of our could be included tasks and removed others that felt extra.

##### We also realized that a sign in/sign up option would be crucial for our app for some of our functions

##### such as favorites. We could allow the user to sign in as a guess as well. So, we moved it up to must

##### be included tasks. Added in our walkthrough many of the things they can do with account

##### Some important tasks we added are many more horizontal tasks. We made many tasks that allow

##### users to edit their choices such as reservations and menu.

##### We changed the task: Allow users to pay in the counter in case their cards have issues. Users that

##### want to pre-order must pay beforehand

## Reflection

##### What we learned from this stage is the process of building up a project. The brainstorm part we

##### learned how to collect our ideas and group them up in an affinity diagram. The affinity diagram

##### allowed us to narrow down certain ideas. After choosing our most promising ideas the storyboard

##### helped us ask questions about what the UI may look like and how it can be used. Creating the low

##### fidelity prototype helped us look at our user tasks from a different perspective.

##### We added and removed some user tasks from stage two from ideas we thought of during the

##### prototype. This stage helped us learn the process behind building a project.

##### What went wrong is that we did not know that Balsamiq had a cloud share option. We would share

##### a person's screen who would make the prototype while others gave ideas and helped. We found

##### out halfway, if we could do this again, we would know to use the cloud immediately. Another

##### problem we had was understanding affinity diagrams. We extracted ideas from our sketches but had

##### no idea on how we would group them. We asked the TA multiple times to explain the affinity

##### diagram to us and eventually we were able to group them.
